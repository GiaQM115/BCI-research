Dataset created by developers of BCI2000 instrumentation system and contributed to PhysioNet

See <link>https://archive.physionet.org/pn4/eegmmidb/</link> for more information

Dataset contains 1500+ EEG recordings lasting 1-2 minutes from 109 volunteers.
R01 and R02 are baseline readings.
R03, R07, and R11 including opening/closing right or left fists
R04, R08, and R12 including imagining the opening/closing of right or left fists
R05, R09, and R13 including opening/closing both hands or both feet
R06, R010, and R14 including imagining the opening/closing of both hands or both feet

Electrodes were positioned according to the Internationl 10/10 system (see montage.pdf)
